Histogram Equalisation

Histogram components are distributed over all intensity range for a high constrast.



So it increases the contrast of the image.





Step 4

Histogram equalisation is used to enhance the contrast of the image. The method outputs the images intensity levels by aproximation of thier probability of occurrance. As displayed in figure 1, the orignal image has histogram components which are localised to high intensity values. As shown in the HE algorithm, the probability of the starfishes intensity is high. This makes output of each starfish darker which aids in their segmentation from the rest of the image. However the uniform manner in which histogram equaltion distrubtes its pixel intesites has led to areas around the starfish have becoming darker in constrast therefore increasing unwanted detail around each starfish. However as displyed in task 6 morpholgical processing can be used to remove such detail whilst still retaing the shape of the 

The origianl images intesity levels are narrowly localised around the higher end of the intensity spectrum. Contrast stretching has subitly expanded the narrow range making the pixel intenisities slighlty darker. This has slightly increased the darkness of the starfish. However, contrast streching has stretched already dark pixel intensities of large artifacts to an even darker end of range which makes them more defined then each starfish. From this, Histogram equalisation appears to be a better option for enhancment. This is because the high probability of each starfishes intenstiy leads to a darker output. As a result, it returns more definition to each starfish than contrast stretching where edges are more defined.

Logarithmic transformation












In binarisation a high threshold can therefore be given which will remove 



In step 5 the binary threshold and will need to be lower in order to retain structure of the starfish therefore keeping other artifacts. Since Hiogram equaliastion increases range across 



Morpholgical processing can be used to remove small dark background detail whilst still retaing the shape of each starfish.
